									<h2><a href="#">About me</a></h2>
								</header>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>I am a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Reading, 
									returning from a 15-month placement as an IT Operations Intern at Urban Science. 
									I am a French international student who was born in the UK, fluent in both English and French. 
									Prior to my degree I did a scientific baccalaureate which is heavily focuses on scientific subjects 
									such as Physics, maths, chemistry and biology. I took an optional python programming subject during 
									this time, which made me keen on studying computer science.
								</p>

								<h2>University</h2>
								<p>
									So far at University, I have been exposed to many different aspects of Computer Science. I will be discussing the programming experience I have had as 
									part of this degree.<br/><br/>  
									In my first year, I was taught fundamental algorithms aswell as programming in C and C++ with a project in C which can be 
									found on this portfolio: <b><a href="supermario.html">Pete’s Pizza Party.</a></b><br/><br/>
									In my second year, I was exposed to database concepts with SQL and Java programming. 
									I had three notable projects this year which can be found on this portfolio: 
									<b><a href="dronesim.html">Drone Simulation</a></b>,
									<b><a href="smtp.html">SMTP in Java</a></b>, 
									<b><a href="platform.html">Android Game</a></b>.<br/><br/>
									In my third year I went on a placement as an IT Operations Intern in Urban Science, 
									more details about the placement can be found below.<br/><br/>
									In my final year, I am going to be completing projects in Unity using the C# language. 
									I have completed one project to date, which can be found on this portfolio: Cal Amity’s House. 
									I will also in the future be exposed to data science with python programming. As part of my final year, 
									I have a year-long project to complete. My final year project will be a 3D Robot Simulation developed in Unity 
									which will involve AI Controlled entities intelligently navigating a 3D world.
								</p>

								<h2>Placement</h2>
								<p>
									For my placement year I was based in Reading. Urban Science is an international company specialising 
									in providing business solutions to automotive companies. My role as an IT Operations Intern was 
									mainly dealing with internal incident and service requests but also included aiding in the maintenance of the 
									hybrid IT infrastructure of the company. As the company uses both on premise and Microsoft Azure, I was heavily 
									exposed to cloud computing concepts particularly when trying to solve asset deployment issues.<br/><br/>
									During my placement I was sent to Frankfurt, Paris and Rome to manage and fix physical assets in the offices 
									at these locations. I regularly worked with employees from around the globe, particularly Europe and the USA. 
									I completed two certificates during this placement: ITIL V4 Foundation and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.
								</p>
							
                                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
								<p>I enjoy fitness. I regularly go to the gym and enjoy playing sports such as basketball and football. As mentioned before, 
									I am also keen on scuba diving. I'm also into skiing, climbing, swimming, calisthenics... just physical activities in general!<br/><br/>
							    I love video games, I have been playing them from a young age and I regularly follow the development of the video game industry (It keeps getting more exciting every year!). Having played
								for the rocket league (A car-football videogame) team at my university, you could say I'm quite competitive...<br/><br/>
							    I enjoy travelling and adventuring, I like to exit my comfort zone by exploring unfamiliar locations. I travel to many different countries every year!</p>
