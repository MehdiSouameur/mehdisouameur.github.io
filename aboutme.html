									<h2><a href="#">About me</a></h2>
								</header>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>I was born in Oxford and moved to France 
									at the age of 9 allowing me to speak both English 
									and French fluently. In French high school (From about age 15 to 18)
									I decided to do a scientific baccalaureate (A-Levels equivalent in the UK)
							        which focuses on science subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology on top of subjects with less weight such as
									History, Philosophy, Literature and Spanish. 
									I also took an optional programming subject which made me do a project in python. Discovering programming in python
									is what made me keen on studying Computer Science.<br/><br/>
									During the first year studying Computer Science at the University of Reading, I was introduced to data structures and
									algorithms in C, navigating and coding in the linux terminal and object oriented programming with
								    C++. I also did a project in C which can be found <a href = "supermario.html"><b>here</b></a>. I was also introduced to software engineering 
									concepts such as agile development.<br/><br/>
									This year, I was introduced to java and more object oriented programming. 
									I completed the drone simulation project in autumn term which can be found <a href = "dronesim.html"><b>here</b></a>. 
									I also learned about databases with a SQL project using postgrSQL, information security with an
									ethical hacking project, Networking by implementing an SMTP protocol in java which can 
									be found <a href = "smtp.html"><b>here</b></a>, Operating systems with weekly labs and more software engineering concepts particularly
									about quality testing.<br/><br/>
								</p>
								<h2>Technical skills</h2>
								<p>Here is a list of my technical skills:<br/><br/>
								-<b>Programming:</b>Confident in Java,C and slightly C++<br/>
							    -<b>Operating Systems:</b> Proficiency using linux and slightly windows<br/>
								-<b>Databases:</b> Knowledge of databases and some SQL<br/>
								-<b>Software Engineering: </b> Solid grasp of Software engineering concepts.<br/><br/>
							    </p>
                                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
								<p>I enjoy working out, I have been going to the gym for a couple years 
								(excluding the covid period where gyms were closed) 
								and recently got into calisthenics which is bodyweight training. 
								I’m physically active and enjoy all sorts of physical activities such as scuba diving or basketball.<br/><br/>
							    I’m passionate about video games, I play all sorts of video games and follow the evolution of the video game
								Industry.<br/><br/>
							    I enjoy travelling and adventuring, I like to go to places brimming with nature such as forests, 
								mountains remote beaches… etc.</p>
